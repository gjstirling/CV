## Summary 

TODO: Add new description/intro 

Working as a coach helped me develop a strong competency in communication, leadership, managing difficult situations and working effectively with my peers. These skills were incredibly useful when working on group projects or in pairing tasks. Allowing me to ensure teams were always moving forward and enjoying the learning process. I received frequent commendation for this from my peers describing the working environment as calm, positive and productive.  

As a person I am very reflective, value good social skills/honesty and have a high emotional awareness.

## About
While travelling and before joining the Makers course I had worked many seasonal/temporary jobs. I have summarised my experience to date and I am happy to discuss my full working history in more detail.

### Capgemini: Scala Developer Worthing Live Services July 2022 - Present
**Description**
Managing and updating existing digital services for HMRC using the Scala play framework.
Collaborating effectively with designers and business analysts to deliver changes/updates to
fit the needs of the service. Praised for my ability to work independently and communicate
concisely during stand ups/meetings. My responsibilities include:

- Monitoring service usage with Kibana
- Testing and Running deployment/production builds via Jenkins

### Miesh.io - Junior Full Stack Javascript Developer Feb 2022 - June 2022
--------

**Description**
Working within a small team constructing the onboarding flow, user authentication service and platform for Miesh.io clients. Created as Microservices which could function independently of one another using the MERN stack. This allowed greater flexibility than that of a monolithic system architecture. Microservices were conceptualised through use of sequence diagrams, technical architecture and flow diagrams. This allowed us to fully understand the layout of the Microservice, its unit test cases, end to end feature testing and visualise the success criteria. Stand ups would provide an opportunity to update on progress, query further information on tickets or highlight any blockers. A summary of my contributions can be found below: 

Onboarding Microservice: 
- Creating a progressive disclosure on the front end to collect user information in a clear and user friendly way. 
- Developing secure backend routes to validate user information and send a verification email to users with a link to set their account password. 
- Providing a login/logout service and password reset flow. 

Platform Microservice: 
- Designed the layout/functionality using MUI components and SAP success factors styling guidelines.
- Developing role based permissions based on a user's persona and requirements. 
- Managing User's notifications and permissions data through use of multiple collections sourced via a user id. 
- Built a Notification service to send information between users and provide service updates/news.

## Skills 

### Leadership

Whilst working as a staff trainer for Whistler Blackcomb, I led training to introduce new skills to staff and highlighting safe working practices. These sessions allowed me to ensure staff understood the concepts and could teach them to clients unsupervised. 

By delivering the content confidently and clearly I was able to help others learn new skills. I was also conscious to digest differing concerns and provide knowledgeable alternatives. Coaching staff allowed me to understand how to collaborate better with others. 

These actions led to staff being inspired by my confidence and understanding. I received positive feedback on how the material was educational and concise. Due to being under time constraints this sometimes led students to needing extra time to improve their understanding. I managed this difficult situation by showing my empathy to students when they didn’t to meet their expectations. With encouragement these students would return after further training and pass on reassessment.

### Communication
During my time at Makers I built on my communication skills developed throughout years of teaching and coaching snowsports. Communication was a skill I felt was one of my strongest and helped me succeed throughout the course. 

While pairing I would create an agreement on how we would work together, plan any breaks and ensure both sides contribute by consistently rotating from driver to navigator.

To aid understanding on our progress I would always reflect on what we had learned. By way of discussion I was able to highlight sections of the task I didn’t understand and also explain the sections I understood if my partner was struggling to get clarity. This allowed myself and my partner to learn more from the task by voicing a loud the material and discussing it. By being open and honest I created a very calming and enjoyable learning experience. 

From this I received regular positive feedback after pairing sessions. Often referring to my demeanour as calm, relaxed and productive. My ability to break down complicated tasks into incremental blocks and be as concise as possible inspired my peers into becoming stronger believers of growth mindset. 

### Emotional Intelligence
While learning at Makers we were provided with an emotional intelligence curriculum. This helped me greatly improve how I managed my emotions/stress and also my ability to perceive the feelings of others. 

During the final team project I had a difficult first week due to a team member being challenging to work with. 

Understanding that this issue was not clear I arranged to having a meeting to discuss these difficulties. I made sure to give the feedback constructively and explain clearly how I felt about the difficulty I was having communicating with them. Primarily due to feeling my feedback was not being accepted and collaboration was very one sided. I wanted to understand their feelings on the matter so I then allowed them to put forward their viewpoint.   

This led to the group member choosing to leave the project due to being unwilling to work on a solution. I was praised by my group for my bravery in dealing with a difficult situation in a calm and honest way. Dealing with this difficult dynamic allowed the group to move forward and finish the project on time. I learned that it is best to be open and transparent at all times during collaborative work. Ultimately this allows teamwork to be much more productive and positive.

## Hobbies and interests 
**Outdoor Activities:**<br>
In particular snowsports, cycling and climbing. Experiencing the outdoors/elements is a great source of relaxation to me outside of working life. My holidays will always include some kind of outdoor physical activity.    

**Formula One:**<br>
What interests me in particular is the way team dynamics can boost performance and the mental resilience drivers need to overcome great external pressure. I also love listening to insights on technical innovations introduced by teams to give them a competitive edge and how strategy can determine the outcome of a race.

**Cooking/Baking:**<br>
Very inspired by asian flavours and dishes. Also enjoy making simple tasty baked goods.
