## Summary 

Recently I have moved into a career change completing a remote 16 week intensive bootcamp with Makers Academy. After spending the last five years living abroad working in the snow-sports industry I needed a new challenge and wanted a new career that allow me to grow professionally. This experience allowed me to understand how to become an effective learner. Accepting challenging tasks, using them as an opportunities to grow and improve. I am a strong believer in having a good working process by following best practices such as test driven development, isolation/single responsibility principle and working incrementally. Allowing my work to be clear, concise and fluid.   

Working as a coach helped me develop a strong competency in communication, leadership, managing difficult situations and working effectively with my peers. These skills were incredibly useful when working on group projects or in pairing tasks. Allowing me to ensure teams were always moving forward and enjoying the learning process. I received frequent commendation for this from my peers describing the working environment as calm, positive and productive.  

As a person I am very reflective, value good social skills/honesty and have a high emotional awareness.

| Title               | About |Tools/Tech       |
| ------------------- | ----- | --------------- |
| [Chitter](https://github.com/gjstirling/Chitter.git)| A CRUD application that enables authenticated users to post ‘peeps’. <br><br> Developed my understanding of client/server relationship and modelling an application in a MVC structure. Learned about RESTful routes, database relationships and improved my ability to debug full stack applications. | Ruby, RSpec, Sinatra, Capybara, HTML, PostgreSQL|
| [Bank](https://github.com/gjstirling/Bank-Tech-test) | An interview style tech test to create a bank account program using the command line. Users can create new account, withdraw, deposit and view their transaction history. <br> <br> This project strengthened my understanding of isolated testing, creating tests on behaviours and following requirements. Discovered using floats can cause rounding errors so manipulated them to integers for accurate calculations. Stabilised tests by using mock dates and creating a feature test that demonstrates the acceptance criteria.   | Ruby, RSpec |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/Nicola-Carroll/acebook)| A engineering team project creating a facebook. clone <br><br> From this I learned how to work with others in an agile way. I helped develop the front-end interface to create an easy to use user friendly application and reguarly guided the group to clearly define tasks for features. | Ruby on rails, HTML, CSS  |

## Skills 

### Leadership

Whilst working as a staff trainer for Whistler Blackcomb, I led training to introduce new skills to staff and highlighting safe working practices. These sessions allowed me to ensure staff understood the concepts and could teach them to clients unsupervised. 

By delivering the content confidently and clearly I was able to help others learn new skills. I was also conscious to digest differing concerns and provide knowledgeable alternatives. Coaching staff allowed me to understand how to collaborate better with others. 

These actions led to staff being inspired by my confidence and understanding. I received positive feedback on how the material was educational and concise. Due to being under time constraints this sometimes led students to needing extra time to improve their understanding. I managed this difficult situation by showing my empathy to students when they didn’t to meet their expectations. With encouragement these students would return after further training and pass on reassessment.

### Communication
During my time at Makers I built on my communication skills developed throughout years of teaching and coaching snowsports. Communication was a skill I felt was one of my strongest and helped me succeed throughout the course. 

While pairing I would create an agreement on how we would work together, plan any breaks and ensure both sides contribute by consistently rotating from driver to navigator.

To aid understanding on our progress I would always reflect on what we had learned. By way of discussion I was able to highlight sections of the task I didn’t understand and also explain the sections I understood if my partner was struggling to get clarity. This allowed myself and my partner to learn more from the task by voicing a loud the material and discussing it. By being open and honest I created a very calming and enjoyable learning experience. 

From this I received regular positive feedback after pairing sessions. Often referring to my demeanour as calm, relaxed and productive. My ability to break down complicated tasks into incremental blocks and be as concise as possible inspired my peers into becoming stronger believers of growth mindset. 

### Emotional Intelligence
While learning at Makers we were provided with an emotional intelligence curriculum. This helped me greatly improve how I managed my emotions/stress and also my ability to perceive the feelings of others. 

During the final team project I had a difficult first week due to a team member being challenging to work with. 

Understanding that this issue was not clear I arranged to having a meeting to discuss these difficulties. I made sure to give the feedback constructively and explain clearly how I felt about the difficulty I was having communicating with them. Primarily due to feeling my feedback was not being accepted and collaboration was very one sided. I wanted to understand their feelings on the matter so I then allowed them to put forward their viewpoint.   

This led to the group member choosing to leave the project due to being unwilling to work on a solution. I was praised by my group for my bravery in dealing with a difficult situation in a calm and honest way. Dealing with this difficult dynamic allowed the group to move forward and finish the project on time. I learned that it is best to be open and transparent at all times during collaborative work. Ultimately this allows teamwork to be much more productive and positive.

## Hobbies and interests 
**Outdoor Activities:**<br>
In particular snowsports, cycling and climbing. Experiancing the outdoors/elements is a great source of relaxation to me outside of working life. My holidays will always include some kind of outdoor physical activity.    

**Formula One:**<br>
What interests me in particular is the way team dynamics can boost performance and the mental resilience drivers need to overcome great external pressure. I also love listening to insights on technical innovations introduced by teams to give them a competitive edge and how strategy can determine the outcome of a race.

**Cooking/Baking:**<br>
Very inspired by asian flavours and dishes. Also enjoy making simple tasty baked goods.
