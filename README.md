#A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.

Recently moved into a career change into software development after completing a remote 16 week intensive bootcamp with Makers Academy. After spending the last five years living abroad working in the snow-sports industry I needed a new challenge and wanted a new career that allow me to grow professionally.

Working as a coach helped me develop a strong competency in communication, leadership, managing difficult situations and working effectively with my peers. These skills were incredibly useful when working on group projects or in pairing tasks. Allowing me to ensure teams were always moving forward and enjoying the learning process. I received frequent commendation for this from my peers describing the working environment as calm, positive and productive.  

My recent experience at Makers really allowed me to understand how to become an effective learner. Accepting when something is difficult, using it as a motivator to grow and become a better developer. I am a strong believer in having a good working process by following best practices such as test driven development, isolation/single responsibility principle and working incrementally. Allowing my work to be clear, concise and fluid.   

As a person I am very reflective, value good social skills/honesty and have a high emotional awareness.
