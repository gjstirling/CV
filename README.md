## Summary

Recently I graduated from a remote 16 week intensive bootcamp with Makers Academy. After spending the last five years living abroad working in the snow-sports industry I needed a new challenge and desired a new career that allow me to grow. As a person I am very reflective, value good social skills/honesty and have a high emotional awareness.

While working as a coach I developed a strong competency in communication, leadership, managing difficult situations and working effectively with peers. These skills were incredibly useful when working on group projects or in pairing tasks. Allowing me to ensure teams were always moving forward and enjoying the learning process. I received frequent commendation for this from my peers describing the working environment as calm, positive and productive.  

Makers have really helped me to understand how to become an effective learner. Accepting when something is challenging, using it as a motivator to grow and become better. The course taught me that I have capability to pick up any language/stack and build applications that could improve the lives of others. This greatly excites and motivates me as I search for my first role.

**Outdoor Activities:**
- In particular snowsports, cycling and climbing. Experiancing the outdoors/elements is a great source of relaxation to me outside of working life. My holidays will always include some kind of outdoor physical activity.    

**Formula One:**
- What interests me in particular is the way team dynamics can boost performance and the mental resilience drivers need to overcome great external pressure. I also love listening to insights on technical innovations introduced by teams to give them a competitive edge and how strategy can determine the outcome of a race.

**Cooking/Baking:**
- Very inspired by asian flavours and dishes. Also enjoy making simple tasty baked goods.
