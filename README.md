#A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.

After graduating from the University of Glasgow I had a desire to travel and see more of the world. I also had a passion for teaching snowsports and it felt like a great oppurnutiy to see different parts of the world.

During the years following I visted Austria, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. I began working in entry level adult, childrens and private lessons but as I gained more expreiance I discovered my passion for freestlye/moguls displine of skiing. When I arrived in Whistler Canada for my first season I realsied this was the ideal place pursue my interests.  

In this role I started as a level captain in the local club program. This role involved managing up to ten instructors and their groups to allow children to be allocated in groups suitable for their ability. Reporting back to supervisors when necessary to communicate any ongoing issues.
The following season I became involved in the the Skier Development program. This focused on introducing children into a structured coaching program. Athletes are trained in race, freestyle and freeride. The athletes then travel to Sun Peaks for a regional competition in which many of my students won mogul, race and ski cross events. This led to me to be awarded coach of the year by my supervisors due to my hard work and patience with two challenging groups of children.

After completing local certifications with freestyle Canada I was promoted to work as a coach in the Freestyle development program with the Whistler Blackcomb roundhouse club. The roundhouse club is a development program for children ranging from eight to twelve years old. Designed to be an introductory program to introduce training mentality and developing strong fundamental skills that can be used across all terrain.

Freestyle development focuses mainly on skills needed to strengthen ability in Slopestyle courses and moguls for comptition. A season long training plan is used to create training focuses which can be adapted relative to the weather conditions. Coaches all attend a mandatory morning briefing followed by a morning training sessions to share coaching ideas and to asses mountain conditions.

Outside of this program I run training sessions for staff members or take adult alpine max 4 lessons. This ranges from terrain park safety to steeps skills training. Both courses are designed to asses the technical ability of staff and their understanding of how to lead clients safely into areas of risk and consequence.
